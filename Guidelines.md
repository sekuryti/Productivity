## Guidelines
- Define Clear Goals: Begin by defining clear and specific goals for your product. Instead of vague statements like "Launch my product," define what "done" looks like. For example, "Launch my product" could mean having ten beta users try the app for a week and provide feedback.
- Start with the Obvious: Break down your goals into the first obvious actions. Make the first action the most obvious one, and name it. For instance, if your goal is to launch a product, the first obvious action could be opening a cloud-based document to brainstorm product features.
- Simplify the Process: Simplify without necessarily simplifying the steps. Recognize that not everything requires going the extra mile. Maximize progress by minimizing unnecessary steps and measuring progress in small increments.
- Make Effortless Progress: Adopt an effortless pace by pacing yourself rather than powering through. Set clear lower and upper bounds for your progress. For example, if your goal is to complete a large report, set a lower bound of drafting an outline and an upper bound of drafting a specified number of pages per day.
- Notice Progress: Achieve a heightened awareness of your progress by focusing on what matters most. Train your mind to notice progress in small increments and celebrate each step towards completion.
- Pair Essential Activities with Enjoyable Ones: Pair essential product planning activities with enjoyable ones. Turn tedious tasks into meaningful rituals and allow laughter and fun to lighten your moments. This helps maintain motivation and enjoyment throughout the product planning process.
- Challenge Assumptions: Challenge the assumption that the "right" way is inevitably the harder one. Make the impossible possible by finding indirect approaches to achieve your goals. When faced with overwhelming tasks, ask yourself how you might be making it harder than it needs to be.
